[ ↗](https://dart.dev#)

Dart supports the operators shown in the following table. The table shows Dart's operator associativity and [operator precedence ↗](https://dart.dev/language/operators#operator-precedence-example) from highest to lowest, which are an **approximation** of Dart's operator relationships. You can implement many of these [operators as class members ↗](https://dart.dev/language/methods#operators).

|Description|Operator|Associativity|
|---|---|---|
|unary postfix|`*expr*++``*expr*--``()``[]``?[]``.``?.``!`|None|
|unary prefix|`-*expr*``!*expr*``~*expr*``++*expr*``--*expr*``await *expr*`|None|
|multiplicative|`*``/``%``~/`|Left|
|additive|`+``-`|Left|
|shift|`<<``>>``>>>`|Left|
|bitwise AND|`&`|Left|
|bitwise XOR|`^`|Left|
|bitwise OR|`|`|Left|
|relational and type test|`>=``>``<=``<``as``is``is!`|None|
|equality|`==``!=`|None|
|logical AND|`&&`|Left|
|logical OR|`||`|Left|
|if null|`??`|Left|
|conditional|`*expr1* ? *expr2* : *expr3*`|Right|
|cascade|`..``?..`|Left|
|assignment|`=``*=``/=``+=``-=``&=``^=`*etc.*|Right|

When you use operators, you create expressions. Here are some examples of operator expressions:

```dart
a++
a + b
a = b
a == b
c ? a : b
a is T
```

## Operator precedence example {#operator-precedence-example}

In the [operator table ↗](https://dart.dev/language/operators#operators), each operator has higher precedence than the operators in the rows that follow it. For example, the multiplicative operator `%` has higher precedence than (and thus executes before) the equality operator `==`, which has higher precedence than the logical AND operator `&&`. That precedence means that the following two lines of code execute the same way:

```dart
// Parentheses improve readability.
if ((n % i == 0) && (d % i == 0)) ...

// Harder to read, but equivalent.
if (n % i == 0 && d % i == 0) ...
```

## Arithmetic operators {#arithmetic-operators}

Dart supports the usual arithmetic operators, as shown in the following table.

|Operator|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`+`|Add|
|`-`|Subtract|
|`-*expr*`|Unary minus, also known as negation (reverse the sign of the expression)|
|`*`|Multiply|
|`/`|Divide|
|`~/`|Divide, returning an integer result|
|`%`|Get the remainder of an integer division (modulo)|

Example:

```dart
assert(2 + 3 == 5);
assert(2 - 3 == -1);
assert(2 * 3 == 6);
assert(5 / 2 == 2.5); // Result is a double
assert(5 ~/ 2 == 2); // Result is an int
assert(5 % 2 == 1); // Remainder

assert('5/2 = ${5 ~/ 2} r ${5 % 2}' == '5/2 = 2 r 1');
```

Dart also supports both prefix and postfix increment and decrement operators.

|Operator|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`++*var*`|`*var* = *var* + 1` (expression value is `*var* + 1`)|
|`*var*++`|`*var* = *var* + 1` (expression value is `*var*`)|
|`--*var*`|`*var* = *var* - 1` (expression value is `*var* - 1`)|
|`*var*--`|`*var* = *var* - 1` (expression value is `*var*`)|

{{< content-ads/middle-banner-1 >}}

Example:

```dart
int a;
int b;

a = 0;
b = ++a; // Increment a before b gets its value.
assert(a == b); // 1 == 1

a = 0;
b = a++; // Increment a after b gets its value.
assert(a != b); // 1 != 0

a = 0;
b = --a; // Decrement a before b gets its value.
assert(a == b); // -1 == -1

a = 0;
b = a--; // Decrement a after b gets its value.
assert(a != b); // -1 != 0
```

## Equality and relational operators {#equality-and-relational-operators}

The following table lists the meanings of equality and relational operators.

|Operator|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`==`|Equal; see discussion below|
|`!=`|Not equal|
|`>`|Greater than|
|`<`|Less than|
|`>=`|Greater than or equal to|
|`<=`|Less than or equal to|

To test whether two objects x and y represent the same thing, use the `==` operator. (In the rare case where you need to know whether two objects are the exact same object, use the [identical() ↗](https://api.dart.dev/stable/dart-core/identical.html) function instead.) Here's how the `==` operator works:

1. If *x* or *y* is null, return true if both are null, and false if only one is null.
2. Return the result of invoking the `==` method on *x* with the argument *y*. (That's right, operators such as `==` are methods that are invoked on their first operand. For details, see [Operators ↗](https://dart.dev/language/methods#operators).)

Here's an example of using each of the equality and relational operators:

```dart
assert(2 == 2);
assert(2 != 3);
assert(3 > 2);
assert(2 < 3);
assert(3 >= 3);
assert(2 <= 3);
```

## Type test operators {#type-test-operators}

The `as`, `is`, and `is!` operators are handy for checking types at runtime.

|Operator|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`as`|Typecast (also used to specify [library prefixes ↗](https://dart.dev/language/libraries#specifying-a-library-prefix))|
|`is`|True if the object has the specified type|
|`is!`|True if the object doesn't have the specified type|

The result of `obj is T` is true if `obj` implements the interface specified by `T`. For example, `obj is Object?` is always true.

Use the `as` operator to cast an object to a particular type if and only if you are sure that the object is of that type. Example:

```dart
(employee as Person).firstName = 'Bob';
```

{{< content-ads/middle-banner-2 >}}

If you aren't sure that the object is of type `T`, then use `is T` to check the type before using the object.

```dart
if (employee is Person) {
  // Type check
  employee.firstName = 'Bob';
}
```

## Assignment operators {#assignment-operators}

As you've already seen, you can assign values using the `=` operator. To assign only if the assigned-to variable is null, use the `??=` operator.

```dart
// Assign value to a
a = value;
// Assign value to b if b is null; otherwise, b stays the same
b ??= value;
```

Compound assignment operators such as `+=` combine an operation with an assignment.

||||||
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`=`|`*=`|`%=`|`>>>=`|`^=`|
|`+=`|`/=`|`<<=`|`&=`|`|=`|
|`-=`|`~/=`|`>>=`|||

Here's how compound assignment operators work:

||Compound assignment|Equivalent expression|
|---|---|---|
|**For an operator *op*:**|`a *op*= b`|`a = a *op* b`|
|**Example:**|`a += b`|`a = a + b`|

The following example uses assignment and compound assignment operators:

```dart
var a = 2; // Assign using =
a *= 3; // Assign and multiply: a = a * 3
assert(a == 6);
```

## Logical operators {#logical-operators}

You can invert or combine boolean expressions using the logical operators.

|Operator|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`!*expr*`|inverts the following expression (changes false to true, and vice versa)|
|`||`|logical OR|
|`&&`|logical AND|

Here's an example of using the logical operators:

{{< content-ads/middle-banner-3 >}}

```dart
if (!done && (col == 0 || col == 3)) {
  // ...Do something...
}
```

## Bitwise and shift operators {#bitwise-and-shift-operators}

You can manipulate the individual bits of numbers in Dart. Usually, you'd use these bitwise and shift operators with integers.

|Operator|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`&`|AND|
|`|`|OR|
|`^`|XOR|
|`~*expr*`|Unary bitwise complement (0s become 1s; 1s become 0s)|
|`<<`|Shift left|
|`>>`|Shift right|
|`>>>`|Unsigned shift right|

Here's an example of using bitwise and shift operators:

```dart
final value = 0x22;
final bitmask = 0x0f;

assert((value & bitmask) == 0x02); // AND
assert((value & ~bitmask) == 0x20); // AND NOT
assert((value | bitmask) == 0x2f); // OR
assert((value ^ bitmask) == 0x2d); // XOR

assert((value << 4) == 0x220); // Shift left
assert((value >> 4) == 0x02); // Shift right

// Shift right example that results in different behavior on web
// because the operand value changes when masked to 32 bits:
assert((-value >> 4) == -0x03);

assert((value >>> 4) == 0x02); // Unsigned shift right
assert((-value >>> 4) > 0); // Unsigned shift right
```

## Conditional expressions {#conditional-expressions}

Dart has two operators that let you concisely evaluate expressions that might otherwise require [if-else ↗](https://dart.dev/language/branches#if) statements:

When you need to assign a value based on a boolean expression, consider using `?` and `:`.

```dart
var visibility = isPublic ? 'public' : 'private';
```

If the boolean expression tests for null, consider using `??`.

```dart
String playerName(String? name) => name ?? 'Guest';
```

The previous example could have been written at least two other ways, but not as succinctly:

```dart
// Slightly longer version uses ?: operator.
String playerName(String? name) => name != null ? name : 'Guest';

// Very long version uses if-else statement.
String playerName(String? name) {
  if (name != null) {
    return name;
  } else {
    return 'Guest';
  }
}
```

## Cascade notation {#cascade-notation}

{{< content-ads/middle-banner-4 >}}

Cascades (`..`, `?..`) allow you to make a sequence of operations on the same object. In addition to accessing instance members, you can also call instance methods on that same object. This often saves you the step of creating a temporary variable and allows you to write more fluid code.

Consider the following code:

```dart
var paint = Paint()
  ..color = Colors.black
  ..strokeCap = StrokeCap.round
  ..strokeWidth = 5.0;
```

The constructor, `Paint()`, returns a `Paint` object. The code that follows the cascade notation operates on this object, ignoring any values that might be returned.

The previous example is equivalent to this code:

```dart
var paint = Paint();
paint.color = Colors.black;
paint.strokeCap = StrokeCap.round;
paint.strokeWidth = 5.0;
```

If the object that the cascade operates on can be null, then use a *null-shorting* cascade (`?..`) for the first operation. Starting with `?..` guarantees that none of the cascade operations are attempted on that null object.

```dart
querySelector('#confirm') // Get an object.
  ?..text = 'Confirm' // Use its members.
  ..classes.add('important')
  ..onClick.listen((e) => window.alert('Confirmed!'))
  ..scrollIntoView();
```

The previous code is equivalent to the following:

```dart
var button = querySelector('#confirm');
button?.text = 'Confirm';
button?.classes.add('important');
button?.onClick.listen((e) => window.alert('Confirmed!'));
button?.scrollIntoView();
```

You can also nest cascades. For example:

```dart
final addressBook = (AddressBookBuilder()
      ..name = 'jenny'
      ..email = 'jenny@example.com'
      ..phone = (PhoneNumberBuilder()
            ..number = '415-555-0100'
            ..label = 'home')
          .build())
    .build();
```

Be careful to construct your cascade on a function that returns an actual object. For example, the following code fails:

```dart
var sb = StringBuffer();
sb.write('foo')
  ..write('bar'); // Error: method 'write' isn't defined for 'void'.
```

The `sb.write()` call returns void, and you can't construct a cascade on `void`.

## Other operators {#other-operators}

You've seen most of the remaining operators in other examples:

|Operator|Name|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|`()`|Function application|Represents a function call|
|`[]`|Subscript access|Represents a call to the overridable `[]` operator; example: `fooList[1]` passes the int `1` to `fooList` to access the element at index `1`|
|`?[]`|Conditional subscript access|Like `[]`, but the leftmost operand can be null; example: `fooList?[1]` passes the int `1` to `fooList` to access the element at index `1` unless `fooList` is null (in which case the expression evaluates to null)|
|`.`|Member access|Refers to a property of an expression; example: `foo.bar` selects property `bar` from expression `foo`|
|`?.`|Conditional member access|Like `.`, but the leftmost operand can be null; example: `foo?.bar` selects property `bar` from expression `foo` unless `foo` is null (in which case the value of `foo?.bar` is null)|
|`!`|Non-null assertion operator|Casts an expression to its underlying non-nullable type, throwing a runtime exception if the cast fails; example: `foo!.bar` asserts `foo` is non-null and selects the property `bar`, unless `foo` is null in which case a runtime exception is thrown|

For more information about the `.`, `?.`, and `..` operators, see [Classes ↗](https://dart.dev/language/classes).
